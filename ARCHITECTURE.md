# InvestBot Architecture Overview

## System Purpose

InvestBot is a conservative, data-driven automated trading system designed to:

- Focus on memecoins and cryptocurrency markets with quick, small-profit trades
- Make decisions using historical data analysis combined with external market intelligence
- Implement strict risk management with frequent small wins rather than large gains
- Support multiple independent instances with different strategies and capital allocations
- Provide simple dashboard monitoring with manual override controls
- Deploy on both Raspberry Pi (home) and EC2 (cloud) environments

### Key Principles

1. **Conservative Approach**: Small, frequent wins through quick trades (1-5% gains)
2. **Data-Driven**: Historical analysis + external intelligence, not prediction
3. **Short-Term Focus**: Quick entries and exits, no long-term position holding
4. **Independent Instances**: Each bot operates autonomously with separate databases
5. **Risk-First**: Strict position limits and frequent profit-taking
6. **Simple & Reliable**: Minimal UI focused on essentials with high reliability

## Component Details
