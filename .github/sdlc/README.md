# SDLC - Self-hosted Claude Code for GitHub Actions

Automate your development workflow with Claude Code AI running on self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. Simply mention `@claude` in any issue or pull request, and Claude will autonomously work on your request.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose installed
- A GitHub repository where you want to use Claude
- Claude Code CLI installed locally

### Step 1: Generate Claude OAuth Token

Run the following command to generate your Claude authentication token:

```bash
claude setup-token
```

Copy the token value that is displayed.

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secret

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to: **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste the token from Step 1
6. Click **Add secret**

### Step 3: Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "SDLC Self-hosted Runner")
4. Select Permissions:
   - âœ… **Administration** (Read-write)
5. Click **Generate token**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't be able to see it again)

### Step 4: Run Setup

Run the setup script and provide the information when prompted:

```bash
./sdlc.sh --setup
```

The script will:

- Build the Claude Code Docker container

```

This will start 5 self-hosted GitHub Actions runners.

### Step 6: Verify Setup

1. Go to your repository: **Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **Runners**
2. You should see 5 runners online (e.g., `gh-runner-1`, `gh-runner-2`, etc.)
